Here are some of my ongoing/finished/abandoned ML projects.

- **bias_variance**: Implementing a polynomial regressor with gradient descent and using it to check the bias-variance tradeoff
- **mnist_nn**: Attempts to make a neural network that converges well. Need to add regularisation.
- **Micrograd**: My implementation of minigrad from Andrej Karpathy. It creates a computation graph so we can apply backpropagation to any kind of network, not just feedforward neural nets (unlike mnist_nn). Similar to how torch.tensor works.
- **wids_datathon_2020**: (ongoing) classification project for hospital mortality prediction
= **loan_prediction**: (ongoing) A simple exercise in EDA and training a logistic regressor
